# Hosting Compatibility Check

## Questions to Answer:

1. **What hosting provider are you using?**
   - Some providers have specific Node.js directories
   - Others don't support Node.js at all

2. **Where did you upload the files?**
   - `public_html/` (likely won't work)
   - `nodejs/` directory (might work)
   - Custom app directory (check provider docs)

3. **What error messages are you seeing?**
   - "Permission denied"
   - "Cannot find module"
   - "Port already in use"
   - "Application failed to start"

4. **Does your hosting plan include Node.js support?**
   - Check your hosting plan features
   - Look for "Node.js" or "Application Hosting"

## Common Shared Hosting Node.js Locations:
- `/home/username/nodejs/`
- `/home/username/apps/`
- `/home/username/private/`
- `/home/username/domains/yourdomain.com/nodejs/`

## Alternative Solutions:

### If Node.js isn't supported:
1. **Static Site + External Backend**
   - Host frontend on shared hosting
   - Use free backend services (Railway, Render, Vercel)

2. **Pure Static Version**
   - Convert to client-side only
   - Use browser-based APIs where possible

### If Node.js is supported but in different location:
1. **Move application to correct directory**
2. **Update configuration paths**
3. **Use provider's Node.js setup tools**
